# ANN-from-Scratch-Learner
Here are the ANN basics codes and notes.
Neural networks are powerful ML models used in image classification, speech recognition, and natural language processing etc.

On can use the many high-level libraries available to build and train neural networks easily, but 2itâ€™s important to have a fundamental understanding of the underlying concepts and mathematics behind them.

So, here we build an ANN from scratch using only the numpy and math libraries in Python. The key concepts handled are forward and backward propagation, activation functions, and loss functions.Each of these steps will be implemented, including initialization, training, and prediction.
